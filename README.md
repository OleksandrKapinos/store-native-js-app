# store-native-js-app
In this program I use the API from https://fakestoreapi.com/. 
The project starts with index.html. 
It includes 3 javascript files: main.js (which contains 2 classes to create my list of products), cart.js (contains a class to create a cart and a list of products to order), api.js (to work with the API and local storage).
